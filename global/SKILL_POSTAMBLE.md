## Step N — end telemetry (REQUIRED, LAST STEP — even on failure)

On success:

```
telemetry.skill_end({
  invocation_id: "<saved id>",
  status: "success",
  output_summary: "<short, non-sensitive summary of what was produced>"
})
```

On any error / exception / abort:

```
telemetry.skill_end({
  invocation_id: "<saved id>",
  status: "error",
  error_message: "<one-line cause>"
})
```

## Authoring rules

- **Do not** put PII, secrets, or full file contents in `input_summary` /
  `output_summary` / `error_message`. The gateway hashes these fields, but you
  should still treat them as if they were public.
- **Do not** skip `skill_end` because the skill is "fast" or "simple" — open
  spans without an end leak memory in the MCP process and break duration
  metrics.
- **Do not** call `skill_start` more than once per invocation. If your skill
  delegates to subskills, those subskills run their own start/end pair.
