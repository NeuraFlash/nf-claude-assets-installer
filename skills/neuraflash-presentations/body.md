## Generation Instructions

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Gather requirements** by asking:
   - Deck type (sales/QBR/kickoff/internal/analytics)?
   - Topic and audience (internal vs. external)?
   - Specific sections or content to include?
   - Contacts to feature on the close slide?
   - Client name (for QBR/joint decks)?

2. **Generate slide content** using the templates above, following the exact formatting patterns (separators, heading levels, stat formats, numbered takeaways, etc.).

3. **Brand compliance checklist** before outputting:
   - [ ] Cover slide uses correct `# NeuraFlash | [Topic]` format
   - [ ] Company overview stats are verbatim (CSAT 4.9, 500+, 2,525, 2016)
   - [ ] All brand claims use the canonical wording
   - [ ] Package slides include pricing + timeline + CTA
   - [ ] External decks end with a Contact slide
   - [ ] Section dividers use single `# Title` with no body text
   - [ ] Every slide has `-----` before and after

4. **Output format**: Write all slides in the markdown separator format, then offer to create the actual Google Slides file using the Google Drive MCP (`create_file` tool).

5. **Tone guidance**:
   - External sales decks: bold, confident, outcome-focused
   - QBR / client decks: structured, data-backed, action-oriented
   - Internal decks: concise, data-forward, no filler
